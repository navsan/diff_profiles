# Introduction
This repository provides a utility script that compares two Google profiler 
outputs (in dot format) and visualizes the diff with heatmap coloring for the
nodes. See [`sample.pdf`](sample.pdf) for an example.

# Usage 
Run the script [`diff_profiles.py`](sample.pdf) with two input dot files as arguments. You 
can optionally provide arguments for output file name, attribute to use 
for performing diff, and threshold value (used for coloring). Just run 
`./diff_profiles.py` to get the usage notes.
